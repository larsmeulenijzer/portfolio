# Lars Meulenijzer - Portfolio of Data Analysis Projects

## Introduction

I am Lars. I am passionate about science and solving problems analytically or by coding. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/larsmeulenijzer/data_analyst_portfolio/blob/63a309738b6339f109d634654cdafabfb9f3d84e/curriculum_vitae_Meulenijzer_Lars.pdf). I obtained a master's degree in theoretical physics and I obtained two bachelor's degrees (physics and mathematics) simultaneously. I have always followed my passion and wish to continue doing so. For that reason, I decided to pursue a career in data analytics. I always continue teaching myself new skills relevant to data science and honing my existing skills.

This portfolio showcases some of the projects that I have worked on. Its purpose is to show not only my competence but also my ability to adapt and keep learning. I keep on adding new projects using new tools and programming languages. This document provides a link to the code of each project as well as a summary of the projects. All digital drawings used in these projects were made by me.

(This portfolio is currently still under construction!)

## Projects

### Binary Alloys Monte Carlo Simulation

**Type:** Python project

**Code:** [binary_alloys.ipynb](https://github.com/larsmeulenijzer/data_analyst_portfolio/blob/64a125c4c521e4549535697b0f1cfe7eb6d4d84f/Python/Binary%20Alloys%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation/binary_alloys.ipynb)

**Summary:** The goal is to simulate a physical process. A binary alloy is a material with two types of atoms. Usually, these are metals. The simulation considers the formation of a thin metal coating that forms when the vaporized atoms condense onto a surface. The question is whether the two types of atoms will mix. Since we are asking a simple question about a system with a large number of identical degrees of freedom, Monte Carlo simulations are ideal for answering this question.

### Mortality Statistical Analysis

**Type:** R project

**Code:** [mortality_in_european_countries_by_age.ipynb](https://github.com/larsmeulenijzer/data_analyst_portfolio/blob/ebc924629ee6f17271f65446dc54578a04904ce0/R/Mortality%20Statistical%20Analysis/mortality_in_european_countries_by_age.ipynb)

**Summary:** The goal is to find statistically significant trends in a dataset with the Mortality rates of European countries in 2018. Two different clusters are discerned within the data and it is found in which ways these clusters differ significantly. Several more statistical techniques are demonstrated. The statistical analysis is carried out very carefully and precisely.

### Exoplanet Data Exploration

**Type:** SQL project

**Code:** [exoplanets.sql](https://github.com/larsmeulenijzer/data_analyst_portfolio/blob/3e30e38c23ec009cded9cc4ebba5162c5467a5bc/SQL/Exoplanet%20Data%20Exploration/exoplanets.sql) and [queries_and_outputs.ipynb](https://github.com/larsmeulenijzer/data_analyst_portfolio/blob/2c2a999e5ed3007e4b6ef7ea7b1ebf9c60e43426/SQL/Exoplanet%20Data%20Exploration/queries_and_outputs.ipynb)

**Summary:** The goal is to explore a table of all exoplanets discovered so far. Several basic SQL queries are demonstrated. This project is limited to manipulating only a single table.

### CO₂ Emission in Flanders

**Type:** Tableau project

**Link to project:** [public.tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lars.meulenijzer/viz/COEmissioninFlanders/Dashboard1)

**Summary:** The goal is to visualize how CO₂ emissions in Flanders have changed from 2011 to 2022. The data is shown on an interactive map.
